            <p class="lead">
              Stockimulate is a platform for open outcry stock exchange simulation competitions.
              Initially developed as a undergraduate project at <b>Concordia University</b> to run the <b>2014 
              John Molson Stock Exchange (JMSX)</b> competition, the platform has undergone several rounds of
              improvement for each edition of JMSX and has recently been adopted by <b><em>Collège Jean-de-Brébeuf</em></b>
              to run their very own competition.
            </p>

                <h5 class="mt-0 mb-1">Real-time Stock Ticker</h5>
                <p>
                  The platform features a real-time ticker for each fictitious traded instrument. The ticker includes the current price,
                  the last change as well as the current quarter, day, and market status (open, or closed).
                </p>
                <p>
                  This page also includes a box for news headlines. Prices, changes, and news are fed to the page and updated dynamically.

                <h5 class="mt-0 mb-1">Trade Entry Form</h5>
                <p>
                  Trades are submitted to into the system through a user-friendly and error-tolerant form. In the context of a competition,
                  this form will be password-protected and accessible only by volunteers who will be in charge of inputing
                  participants' trades. Furtheremore, volunteers can be limited to which instruments they're allowed to process trades for,
                  which is particularly useful if the trading floor is divided into individual trading pits for each instrument.

                <h5 class="mt-0 mb-1">Profit &amp; Loss Reports</h5>
                <p>
                  As part of the competition, teams and players can keep track of their performance by viewing their 
                  cumulative P&amp;L reports. The report includes individual P&amp;L as well as team P&amp;L, each segmented
                  into realized and unrealized components for each traded instrument, using the spot price as theoretical 
                  exit price.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The team's average individual P&amp;L is also given for reference purposes since teams are ranked on 
                  average P&amp;L in order to factor in teams of different sizes.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The current position, average open price, and current spot price are also displayed in the report.

                <p>
                  As this is a simulation, it is expected that teams and participants will try to cheat through collusion.
                  Fortunately, the platform features a page where an administrator can search through trades. Trades flagged
                  by the system for having too large of discrepancy between the trade price and spot price at the time of trade
                  will be highlighted in <b class="text-danger">red</b>.

              <h2>Tech Stack</h2>
              <p class="lead">Stockimulate is implemented as an <b>ASP.NET Core MVC</b> application with a 
                plain-old <b>HTML5</b>, <b>CSS3</b>, and <b>JavaScript</b> front-end, with the unparalelled
                magic of <b>Bootstrap</b> with <b>Font Awesome</b> glyphs.  
              </p>
              <p>
                The ticker charts are implemented using <b>Chart.js</b>.
              </p>
              <p>
                Real-time updates are made possible through the use of <b>Pusher</b>.
              </p>
              <p>
                The platform is designed for hosting on a <b>Microsoft Azure App Service</b>.
              </p>
              <p>
                The code is hosted on <b>GitHub</b> as a public repository open-sourced with the <b>MIT License</b>.
              </p>
              <p>
                Debugging was primarily done on <b>Google Chrome</b> but various other browsers were used for testing
                and compatibility purposes, including <b>Safari</b>, <b>Mozilla Firefox</b>, <b>Microsoft Edge</b>,
                and <b>Internet Explorer</b>.
              </p>
              <p>
                Development of the current version was mostly done on <b>Visual Studio Code</b> (I opted 
                for the <b>Insiders</b> build). Although I feel it necessary to also acknowledge <b>Microsoft</b> 
                for their wonderful work on <b>Visual Studio for Mac</b> as well as well as the various earlier 
                versions of <b>Visual Studio</b> without which this project would never have seen the light of day,
                back when it was powered by ASP.NET Web Forms.
              </p>
              <p>
                I also took advantage of <b>JetBrains'</b> phenomenal new .NET IDE, <b>Rider</b> as well as the 
                invaluable <b>ReSharper</b> add-on for Visual Studio, all of which were made available through 
                generous trial and student licenses as well as Early Access Previews.
