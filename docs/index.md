# About Stockimulate

Stockimulate is an open outcry stock exchange simulation platform used to run stock trading competitions.

Undergoing several iterations and improvements, the platform has been used for every JMSX since 2014 and has recently been adopted to run the **_Simulation Boursière Brébeuf_** at **_Collège Jean-de-Brébeuf_** in Montreal, QC.
