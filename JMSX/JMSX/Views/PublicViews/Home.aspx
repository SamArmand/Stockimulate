    <h2>A Word with the President</h2>
    
    <p class="lead">On November 8th 2016, US Republican Presidential Candidate Ronald Trumped got elected as the 45th President of the United States*. With a majority senate as well as the possession of power of the executive branch, President Trumped swiftly began to veto bills into law that will, according to him, Make American Great Again! However, the global markets did not took this headline very well. The entire Asian stock market crashed overnight due to speculation over Ronald’s mad veto spree that would eventually adversely affect trade. Negative economic indicators rapidly followed suit across the globe. The Asian market’s pullback’s effects spread across the EU as well the US. A year after President Trumped took office, the world got into a recession worse than the Great Recession of ‘08. </p>
      
      <p class="lead">Ronald wants to make clear to the people that he was not responsible for all this and that he has a solution. To his defence, he took on Charlie Blue’s 60 Minutes to answer some questions. Here is a sample from the interview:</p>
    
    <blockquote><strong>Trumped:</strong> Charlie, let me tell you, we’ve got the BEST man to handle this job. My man Carl HeCahn (US Secretary of the Treasury) did deals for years; he totally has this under control.</blockquote>
    
    <blockquote class="blockquote-reverse"><strong>Charlie:</strong> Mr HeCahn is a great businessman – we both know that. But right now, to fix the world economy, don’t you think we need an experienced economist instead?</blockquote>
    
    <blockquote><strong>Trumped:</strong> Listen Charlie, before I became President, I made deals for a living. I was great at it. I even wrote a book on making deals. Everywhere you go it’s all about deals, deals, deals and more deals. I think that to solve this problem, we need to make a deal with China.</blockquote>
    
    <blockquote class="blockquote-reverse"><strong>Charlie:</strong> What about China?</blockquote>
    
    <blockquote><strong>Trumped</strong> My friend Carl has connections.</blockquote>
    
    <blockquote class="blockquote-reverse"><strong>Charlie:</strong> What kind of connections?</blockquote>
    
    <blockquote><strong>Trumped</strong> I’ll give you one word: GOLD.</blockquote>
    
    <p class="lead">As soon as the words GOLD was muttered, global markets received mixed reactions. </p>
    
    <footer>* One of Mr. Trumped’s secret campaign donors is MBQ Medici Bank of Quebec. In an effort to further expand to the US Capital Markets deal flow, MBQ’s surprise strategy patiently awaits their payoff.</footer>
