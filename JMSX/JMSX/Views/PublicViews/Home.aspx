    <h2>A Word with the President</h2>
    
    <p class="lead">On November 8th 2016, US Republican Presidential Candidate Ronald Trumped was elected as the 45th President of the United States. With the executive power granted to the nation’s highest office, President Trumped swiftly began to decree bills into law. According to Trumped, these executive orders will, beyond the shred of a doubt (or humility), Make American Great Again! Most, if not all, of Mr. Trumped’s attention was geared towards foreign policy rather than alleviating the mounting domestic inequality crisis facing the commander in chief. His corsairs were unmistakably aimed at China, which felt the full strength of his wrath. Unsurprisingly, the global markets’ response to this frantic legislative agenda was catastrophic. Asian equity markets crashed overnight as investors feared that what came to be known as “Ronald’s Mad Spree” would harm trade. Negative economic indicators followed suit across the globe. The Asian market’s pullback effects spread across the EU as well the US. A meagre year after President Trumped took office, the full impact if his policies were felt and the world fell into a more formidable recession than the Great Recession of ‘08.</p>
      
      <p class="lead">In order to clear his name and remind the world that only he can fix the problem he most definitely did not create, President Trumped appeared on Charlie Blue’s 60 Minutes. Here is a sample of the interview that once again rocked the financial markets:</p>
    
    <br />

    <blockquote><strong>Trumped:</strong> Charlie, let me tell you, we’ve got the BEST man to handle this job. My man Carl HeCahn (US Secretary of the Treasury) did deals for years; he totally has this under control.</blockquote>
    
    <blockquote class="blockquote-reverse"><strong>Charlie:</strong> Mr. HeCahn is a great businessman – we both know that. But right now, to fix the world economy, don’t you think we need an experienced economist instead?</blockquote>
    
    <blockquote><strong>Trumped:</strong> Listen Charlie, before I became President, I made deals for a living. I was great at it. I even wrote a book on making deals. Everywhere you go it’s all about deals, deals, deals and more deals. I think that to solve this problem, we need to make a deal with China.</blockquote>
    
    <blockquote class="blockquote-reverse"><strong>Charlie:</strong> What about China?</blockquote>
    
    <blockquote><strong>Trumped</strong> My friend Carl has connections.</blockquote>
    
    <blockquote class="blockquote-reverse"><strong>Charlie:</strong> What kind of connections?</blockquote>
    
    <blockquote><strong>Trumped</strong> I’ll give you one word: GOLD.</blockquote>

    <br/>

    <p class="lead">As soon as the words GOLD was muttered, global markets received mixed reactions. </p>

    <h3>GDP Growth</h3>
    
    <p class="lead">GDP represents the total value of the country's production during the period and consists of the purchases of domestically-produced goods and services by individuals, businesses, foreigners and government entities. Investors need to closely track the economy because it usually dictates how investments will perform.</p>
    
    <br/>

    <h3>Unemployment Rate</h3>
    
    <p class="lead">The unemployment rate is a measure of the prevalence of unemployment and it is calculated as a percentage by dividing the number of unemployed individuals by all individuals currently in the labor force. During periods of recession, an economy usually experiences a relatively high unemployment rate.</p>
    
    <br/>

    <h3>Interest Rates</h3>
    
    <p class="lead">The federal funds rate, or interest rate, is the rate at which depository institutions can borrow from the Federal Reserve Bank. The federal funds rate can be viewed as the base rate that determines the level of all other interest rates in the economy. During a period of low interest rate, companies have access to inexpensive capital that can be used for capital expenditure projects.</p>
    
    <br/>

    <h3>News</h3>
    
    <p class="lead">News items are released sporadically throughout each quarter. They consist of general news reports, industry and company specific news. It might have a direct impact with two different markets; the trader should use judgment to correctly interpret important news. <strong>Be careful as not all news items are relevant</strong>.</p>
