    <h2>The House of Cards</h2>

    <blockquote>
        
        <p>“The European Union was a noble dream, but as happens with most dreams, reality eventually sets in. It is simply not possible to maintain economic unity and a single monetary policy among a collection of states each of which sets its own fiscal policies. Europe’s sovereign debt was the first sign that something was structurally wrong. Germany spent years loaning euros to poorer Eurozone countries, so they could buy German-made goods. Other exporting nations within the EU did the same. The resulting trade imbalance had to show itself somewhere. It did… in the government debts of countries like Greece, Italy, Spain, Portugal, and Ireland. Now add the political tensions from the migrant crisis and Brexit, and Europe’s collapse becomes increasingly real. </p>
        
        <br/>
        
        <p>The European Central Bank is becoming dangerously over-extended and the whole euro project is unworkable in its current form. One day, the house of cards will collapse. The euro has been betrayed by politics, lamenting that the experiment went wrong from the beginning and has since degenerated into a fiscal free-for-all that once again masks the festering pathologies. Realistically, it will be a case of muddling through, struggling from one crisis to the next. The Eurozone has not overcome its structural incoherence. A beguiling combination of cheap oil, a cheap euro, quantitative easing and less fiscal austerity have disguised this, but the short-term effects are already fading.</p>
        
        <br/>
        
        <p>There are many possible outcomes to a European financial crisis stemming from massive sovereign debts and unbalanced budgets. What would save Europe is Germany getting rid of the euro and returning to the Deutsch Mark. If poorer southern EU countries left the euro, they would face a huge debt repayment. But if Germany were to drop the euro, the value of the single currency would plummet, and as a result, struggling member states would become more competitive. The boost in exports would stimulate economies in the southern periphery.”</p>

    <h3>The Euro</h3>
    
    <p class="lead">The relation of the euro against the US dollar is designated as EUR/USD. Here, the euro is the base currency and the US dollar is the counter currency. Therefore, the quotation EUR/USD 1.25 means that it takes 1.25 US dollars to buy 1 euro. Currently, the pair is trading at par (EUR/USD 1.00), implying that it takes 1,000 USD to buy 1,000 euro for example. When indicators show a strong and growing economy, currency tends to appreciate. Keep in mind that you are trading the euro against the USD. Therefore, the EUR/USD is also expected to appreciate if the US dollar depreciates. </p>
